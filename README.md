### Overview
This project uses data from the past two years of SAT/ACT tests from all 50 states and the District of Columbia to analyze patterns and come to the conclusion that the best way for participation to increase is for the state in question to mandate that test, as it already has done in many states, and will continue to do so in many more in the coming years, if this single interval is any indication.
